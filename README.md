# 👋 Hi, I'm xdrew87 (aka galmx)

🧠 I'm currently learning:
- 🔹 **Cybersecurity** (OSINT, red teaming, digital forensics)
- 🔹 **Python** for automation, tooling, and recon
- 🔹 **C++** for building low-level and performance-based tools

🛠️ I build custom tools for red team simulation, packet sniffing, and public recon — all for **educational use only**.
